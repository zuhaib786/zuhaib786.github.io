<!----
- **Simple Git**(In progress)
    - Implemented a cli to make running of day to day git commands easy.
    - Personal project to ease my day to day work @sprinklr
--->
- **Triangulation of Solid Surfaces**
    - Designed a system which stored the triangulation data of a solid curve and supported various queries regarding the solid
    - The system involved the realization of triangulation of solid curves and their features using graph data structure
    - The system supported various queries like the type of the solid, centroid, diameter, the nearest neighbours of triangles
    - Implemented the system using graph data structure, Union-Find data structure, Red-black trees and Tries
- **Meme classifcation**
    - Designed various models for classifying memes as funny from the images and the caption of the images
    - Designed multimodal model using pre-trained CNN for image encoding and pre-trained transformer for text embedding.
    - Implemented a sentiment classifer using textBlob, BertTransformer and fastText and compared the results
- **Ship detection from aerial images**
    - Implemented a run-length encoder and decoder for masks masking ship locations given as input format
    - Implemented and trained a U-net architecture for image segmentation into ship and non-ship segments
    - Trained YOLOv3 from darknet master on custom dataset of 1000 images on google colab GPU for 8 hours
