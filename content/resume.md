## Experience
- **Sprinklr Product Engineer [July 2023 – Present]**
    - Engineered comprehensive monitoring and telemetry tools to analyze cloud hosting costs, 
    enabling accurate cost distribution across microservices within the cluster,complemented 
    by real-time visualization dashboards for trend analysis.
    - Designed and implemented an automation framework to optimize cloud hosting costs 
    through safe, resilient processes with self-monitoring capabilities and automated rollback mechanisms.
    - Developed a Kubernetes-based health check and audit framework for microservices, fostering adherence 
    to best practices across teams and enhancing service resiliency through continuous cluster health monitoring.
    - Created versatile SDKs that streamline routine operations, including database CRUD services and 
    credential management, empowering teams to integrate these functionalities seamlessly into their workflows
    and microservices architecture.
- **Sprinklr Product Engineer Intern [June 2022 - Aug 2022]**
    - Designed and implemented a paraphrasing bot to generate multiple human-like paraphrased sentences for diverse use cases.
    - Built a framework to automatically evaluate generated sentences based on relevance, diversity, and quality metrics.
    - Achieved superior generative performance compared to state-of-the-art open-source models (e.g., T5), enhancing output relevance and fluency.
