With a strong foundation in software engineering, I have successfully designed and implemented automation frameworks that significantly reduce cloud hosting expenses. By leveraging advanced technologies, I ensure that our systems are not only cost-effective but also scalable and robust.
In addition to automation, I am actively involved in optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference processes. This includes the development of software development kits (SDKs) and tools tailored for internal teams, facilitating smoother workflows and enhancing productivity.">
