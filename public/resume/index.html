Sprinklr Product Engineer [July 2023 – Present]

Engineered comprehensive monitoring and telemetry tools to analyze cloud hosting costs,
enabling accurate cost distribution across microservices within the cluster,complemented
by real-time visualization dashboards for trend analysis.
Designed and implemented an automation framework to optimize cloud hosting costs
through safe, resilient processes with self-monitoring capabilities and automated rollback mechanisms.
Developed a Kubernetes-based health check and audit framework for microservices, fostering adherence
to best practices across teams and enhancing service resiliency through continuous cluster health monitoring.
Created versatile SDKs that streamline routine operations, including database CRUD services and
credential management, empowering teams to integrate these functionalities seamlessly into their workflows
and microservices architecture.


Sprinklr Product Engineer Intern [June 2022 - Aug 2022]

Designed and implemented a paraphrasing bot to generate multiple human-like paraphrased sentences for diverse use cases.
Built a framework to automatically evaluate generated sentences based on relevance, diversity, and quality metrics.
Achieved superior generative performance compared to state-of-the-art open-source models (e.g., T5), enhancing output relevance and fluency.
