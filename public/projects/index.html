Triangulation of Solid Surfaces

Designed a system which stored the triangulation data of a solid curve and supported various queries regarding the solid
The system involved the realization of triangulation of solid curves and their features using graph data structure
The system supported various queries like the type of the solid, centroid, diameter, the nearest neighbours of triangles
Implemented the system using graph data structure, Union-Find data structure, Red-black trees and Tries


Meme classifcation

Designed various models for classifying memes as funny from the images and the caption of the images
Designed multimodal model using pre-trained CNN for image encoding and pre-trained transformer for text embedding.
Implemented a sentiment classifer using textBlob, BertTransformer and fastText and compared the results


Ship detection from aerial images

Implemented a run-length encoder and decoder for masks masking ship locations given as input format
Implemented and trained a U-net architecture for image segmentation into ship and non-ship segments
Trained YOLOv3 from darknet master on custom dataset of 1000 images on google colab GPU for 8 hours
